---

### Persona 4: Founder / CEO (Post-PMF SaaS)
**Title:** CEO, Founder, Chief Product Officer
**Company Size:** 20-150 employees

## Lead Generation Funnel

### Stage 1: Awareness
**Goal:** Get the right person to know we exist

**Tactics:**
- LinkedIn outreach (warm intro)
- Blog posts (organic search)
- Community participation

**KPI:** 20-30 outreach touches/week → 10% response rate = 2-3 conversations/week

---

### Stage 2: Interest
**Goal:** Show them we understand their problem

**Tactics:**
- Discovery call (20 min): "Tell me about your biggest operational bottleneck"
- Share relevant case study
- Invite to webinar if timely

**KPI:** 50% of conversations → qualify as potential fit

---

### Stage 3: Consideration
**Goal:** Show them the ROI

**Tactics:**
- Free ROI calculator (they input data, we show payback period)
- Light audit: "If you sent me your current workflow, I can estimate savings"
- Proposal (if obvious fit)

**KPI:** 70% of qualified leads → request proposal

---

### Stage 4: Decision
**Goal:** Remove friction, close the deal

**Tactics:**
- Clear pricing, simple contract (1-page SOW)
- Discount for annual commitment (prepay 12 months, save 2 months)
- Fast onboarding (kick-off within 5 days)

**KPI:** 40-60% close rate on proposals → deal closed

---

## Sales Process

### Discovery Call (20 minutes)
**Goal:** Understand their problem and size the opportunity

**Questions:**
1. "What's your biggest operational headache right now?"
2. "How many hours/week is this costing your team?"
3. "What have you already tried?"
4. "If you could automate one workflow perfectly, what would it be?"
5. "What's your timeline?"

**Outcome:**
- Qualified (good fit) → Move to proposal
- Not ready (timeline > 2 months) → Add to nurture sequence
- Not right fit (too small, too niche) → Polite pass, stay in network

---

### Proposal (Email + Call)
**What It Includes:**
- Executive summary (problem + solution in 1 page)
- Scope: 3-5 specific workflows to automate
- Timeline: 3 week build → 2 week optimization → go-live
- Pricing: Service tier + monthly management fee
- Success metrics: Hours saved, error reduction, turnaround time
- Next steps: Kick-off call + access to onboarding docs

**Turnaround:** Within 24 hours of discovery call

---

### Onboarding (Weeks 1-3)
**Timeline:**
- Day 1: Kick-off call + access to project dashboard
- Days 2-5: Requirements gathering (detailed workflow interviews)
- Days 6-14: Agent development (daily async updates)
- Days 15-21: Testing + optimization
- Day 21: Go-live + training

**Handoff:** Client account manager assigned for monthly management

## Outreach Templates

### LinkedIn Message (Initial Outreach)

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is in the [Operations/Sales/CS] space, and I'm curious if you're dealing with what most directors are right now—teams spending too much time on manual work instead of strategic stuff.

We work with mid-market companies to automate their biggest operational bottlenecks with AI agents. For most, it frees up 10-20 hours per week per person.

Would a quick 20-minute call make sense? We could look at your current workflow and I could tell you what's actually possible.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

---

### Email Outreach (Cold)

```
Subject: [Name] — 12 hours/week of ops work automated?

Hi [Name],

Most ops teams spend 40+ hours/week on manual, repetitive work: data entry, status updates, report generation.

We help mid-market companies cut that in half with AI agents. Typical project:
- 3-week build
- $8K upfront
- $500/mo ongoing
- 12-20 hours saved per week

We worked with [similar company] and cut their monthly reconciliation work from 16 hours to 2.

Worth a quick conversation? [Link to calendar]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

---

### ROI Calculator Email (Follow-up)

```
Subject: Your potential labor savings

Hi [Name],

I put together a quick calculator so you can see the actual dollar impact of automating your biggest workflow.

If your team spends even 2 hours/week on [specific task], you're looking at ~$30K/year in labor costs that could be freed up.

[Link to calculator]

Curious what the number looks like for you?

Best,
[Your Name]
```
